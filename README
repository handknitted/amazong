The aim is to provide a server that accepts music files/folders added to a location, moves them to a library location as flac and can provide a view of that library encoded into other formats.

Requirements:

- don't overwrite flac files if they already exist
- tag files with the source so that it's known what bitrate and codec was in use before coercion
- retain any tags that were in place before
- maintain consistency with filenames
- compatible for use as cron task
- simple usage with command and source and quarantine path
- clean up created files in the even of failure
- allow iterative execution - so if command exits at any point re-invoking will allow the process to resume without
missing files
- possibly only look *n* files ahead where *n* is configurable in the command

At this point I'm not concerned about additional features like replay gain, normalisation etc
