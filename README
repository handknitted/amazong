The aim of this script is to walk a filesystem, find files that cannot be
handled by fuse mp3 fs and coerce them into flac.

Requirements:

- don't overwrite flac files if they already exist
- tag files with the source so that it's known what bitrate and codec was in use before coercion
- retain any tags that were in place before
- maintain consistency with filenames
- simple usage with command and source and quarantine path
- clean up created files in the even of failure
- allow iterative execution - so if command exits at any point re-invoking will allow the process to resume without
missing files
- possibly only look *n* files ahead where *n* is configurable in the command

At this point I'm not concerned about additional features like replay gain, normalisation etc
